# Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection

[Website](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/)

Note that the games do not save any setup state but you can
provide as a command line parameter when you invoke them.
For example:

    > inertia.exe 15x12
    > slant.exe 12x10

You can configure the game and then look in the run random seed
menu selection and the part before the `#` is the setup info.

BTW: Simon Tatham wrote putty
